Welcome to <bold>Student Data Management System</bold>

- A super cozy and super flexible Database Management System using Modded Tkinter GUI and MySQL for the Data Management

<bold> What's Modded Tkinter GUI ? </bold> 
- So Basically Tkinter is a GUI interface made with TCL provided by Python itself .
  However the GUI is made strictly for prototyping and testing .. Hence Python stopped maintaining the GUI designs
  However they did make a new module design called "ttk" but that limits the oppurtunities for designing the GUi

  Hence I decided to take some crucial steps and design my GUI like a real app
